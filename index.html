                <h1>Austin Mesh</h1>
                <p>Austin Mesh is a community group working to build a mesh network of solar-powered <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">meshtastic</a> radios in Austin. This network acts like a city-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network. All of this happens without any external infrastructure - no power, no cell phone towers, no internet.</p>

                <h2>Learn about Meshtastic and Austin Mesh</h2>
                <h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
                <p>We have set up a number of solar-powered radio repeaters in Austin. These radios communicate on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33-centimeter_band">906.875 MHZ</a> frequency using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa protocol</a>. The radios mesh using the open-source <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> software. Users can connect to these repeaters by Bluetooth if they’re close enough or they can use their own handheld nodes which will also act as repeaters. The messages hop from node to node, extending the reach of the network and ensuring everyone receives every message.</p>
                <h3 id="eli5">Can you explain it like I'm 5?</h3>
                <p>Pretend you're sitting in class and want to send a note to everyone in the class. You write your note on a piece of paper and copy it three times. The message can be up to 228 characters - about as long as this paragraph so far. You hand those three pieces of paper to the three people around you. Then those three people re-write the message three times and hand it to the three people around them and so on. Now imagine a big gust of wind comes and blows away some of the messages. If even just a few people saw the note and keep copying and re-sending it, eventually everyone will get a copy of the note. This is like sending an unencrypted message to everyone on the network.</p>
                <p>Now imagine you want to send a message to a single person or a select group of people but you don't want other people who see the note to be able to read it. You could write the note using a secret language. You could then hand a decoder key to your friend or to a group of friends and they could decode the message. The message still gets passed the same way - with every single person writing the message a few times and handing it to everyone - but only those people with the decoder key will be able to understand the message. This is like sending an encrypted direct message or encrypted group message.</p>
                <p>Austin Mesh works the same way as this paper example, but instead of sending paper notes we're using digital text messages and sending it with radio waves. Our radios are solar powered and they don’t need any internet or cell phone coverage. This means they will work even if the power is out.</p>
                <h3 id="what-can-it-do">What can it do?</h3>
                <p>Meshtastic is a bit like a decentralized social media platform or SMS text messaging. It has a number of different features which will be familiar to anyone who has sent a text message or posted on social media.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>1) Primary Channel:</dt>
                    <dd>You can broadcast an unencrypted message to the Primary Channel and everyone on your mesh will see it. This is a bit like “posting” publicly on a social media platform.</dd>
                    <dt>2) Group Channels:</dt>
                    <dd>You can send an encrypted message to a select group of people on a Secondary Channel and everyone who is subscribed to that channel will get it. People can join the channel if you provide them with an encryption key which you can send to them via Direct Message or which they can scan from a QR code in person. This is a bit like a private group on social media, or a group text message chain on SMS.</dd>
                    <dt>3) Direct Messages:</dt>
                    <dd>You can send encrypted direct messages to people on the mesh. This is like a private text message or a DM on social medial.</dd>
                    <dt>4) Location:</dt>
                    <dd>If you choose to enable it you can send your location to the mesh and it will show up on everyone’s map in the app.</dd>
                    <dt>5) Connect Worldwide:</dt>
                    <dd>If anyone on your local mesh is running an MQTT gateway your local mesh will connect to the other meshes around the world. This can allow you to broadcast messages to everyone globally or send encrypted messages to groups or individuals worldwide.</dd>
                    <dt>6) Telemetry Data:</dt>
                    <dd>Nodes can be set up to send telemetry data like the battery status or signal strength, which is helpful for monitoring remote solar-powered nodes. Nodes can also have sensors connected to them which allow them to send data on temperature, humidity, or air pressure which allow them to act like weather stations.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3 id="why-build-network">Why build this network?</h3>
                <h4>1) Community</h4>
                <p>Because this is essentially a city-wide group text message chain we are hoping people use the network to build community. Tell the group where your band is playing tonight, chat about local politics, ask for a good cheese dip recipe, etc.</p>
                <h4>2) Disasters</h4>
                <p>If the power goes out, like during the 2021 Winter Storm Uri, this network should allow people to continue to communicate with each other without electricity, cell phone coverage, or internet. This big city-wide group text chain could allow people to ask for help or offer assistance. People could get information about where warming centers are open or ask who in their neighborhood still has power. People could also send encrypted direct messages to check in on friends and family or they could send encrypted group messages to coordinate privately in a group.</p>
                <h4>3) Decentralized, Open, and Resilient</h4>
                <p>Austin Mesh is decentralized - there is no central server or corporation - all the communication bounces through the entire mesh. Austin Mesh is open to everyone - you don't have to ask permission to join and all of the software is open-source. Austin Mesh is resilient - our solar-powered radios don't need cell phone towers, internet access, or electricity. We hope this project will inspire others to build things that are decentralized, open, and resilient.</p>
                <h3 id="coverage">What kind of coverage does the Austin Mesh network have?</h3>
                <p>As of Summer 2024 we have coverage throughout most of downtown, central, and East Austin. We have intermittent coverage in South, Southwest (all the way to Dripping Springs), North, and even all the way up to Leander. We're actively working to expand this coverage.</p>
                <p><a href="https://meshmap.net/">The MQTT map at meshmap.net</a> is <b>not</b> representative of the coverage as we <a href="#best-practices">do not recommend using MQTT</a> however it may still be useful for you to see what is in your area. Another <a href="https://canvis.app/meshtastic-map">map of <b>self reported</b> nodes</a> is also available, but more likely to be out-of-date.</p>
                <h3 id="meshtastic-vs-aprs">Comparing it to APRS on Ham Radio</h3>
                <p>For people who are familiar with using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System">Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) </a> on ham radio, Meshtastic is <strong>similar</strong> in a few ways:</p>
                <h4>Similarities</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Digipeaters</dt>
                    <dd>APRS radios can be set up as clients, which receive all messages and only transmit the users messages, or APRS radios can be set up as digipeaters, which repeat all the messages they hear. Meshtastic radios by default all act as repeaters – just like APRS digipeaters.</dd>
                    <dt>iGates</dt>
                    <dd>MQTT Gateways are like APRS iGates – they repeat all local traffic over the internet to other MQTT Gateways around the world.</dd>
                    <dt>ANSRVR</dt>
                    <dd>APRS users can subscribe to groups using the ANSRVR service. This allows for group chats like the popular #APRSThursday net. Meshtastic has “Secondary Channels” that can be subscribe to, allowing users to send messages to everyone on the channel.</dd>
                    <dt>Burst</dt>
                    <dd>APRS uses the AX.25 protocol which sends messages using data bursts between 0.3 and 0.5 seconds long. Meshtastic uses the LoRa protocol which sends messages in data bursts between 0.5 and 10 seconds long.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h4>Differences</h4>
                <p>But Meshtastic is also <strong>different</strong> than APRS in a few ways:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Primary</dt>
                    <dd>APRS doesn’t have a way to broadcast a message to everyone on the network. Messages sent to Meshtastic's Primary Channel go to everyone.</dd>
                    <dt>Encryption</dt>
                    <dd>APRS is unencrypted because it is illegal to use encryption over ham radio. Meshtastic is encrypted for communications on private group channels and for direct messages between users, because it runs on the 900 MHz ISM band, which does not have restrictions on encryption.</dd>
                    <dt>License</dt>
                    <dd>APRS requires the user to have a ham radio license. Meshtastic does not require any license and is open for anyone to use.</dd>
                    <dt>Equipment Cost</dt>
                    <dd>APRS capable handheld ham radios cost upwards of $400. Meshtastic radios cost less than $100.</dd>
                    <dt>Email</dt>
                    <dd>APRS has services which allow users to send emails and SMS text messages to people who aren’t ham radio users. Meshtastic does not have this feature but it could be added in the future.</dd>
                    <dt>Simplicity</dt>
                    <dd>APRS is quite a bit more difficult to use than Meshtastic. APRS does not have any standardized user interface – there are dozens of software packages available. Meshtastic has a standardized iPhone and Android app which is easy to understand for new users.</dd>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Get a Meshtastic Radio.
                        <br> You can build one yourself for about $35. The official Meshtastic page keeps a current list of <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/">Supported Hardware.</a> The LILYGO T-Echo is a good first meshtastic radio, as it costs around $70 and is ready to go out of the box (besides having to flash the firmware).
                        <br> You can also buy a pre-built battery-powered radio for between $50-$100 on Etsy or eBay - these usually have 3D printed cases.
                        <br> If you can afford it, and have a place to mount it outside, we recommend you buy a pre-built solar-powered node for between $100 and $200 on Etsy and mount it as high off the ground as you can. Alternatively you can <a href="#building-a-solar-powered-repeater">build your own</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Download the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/software">Meshtastic App</a> on your iPhone or Android.</li>
                    <li>Pair your radio to your phone with Bluetooth.</li>
                    <li>Open the Meshtastic app and say hi!</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>
                <h4>TL;DR;</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MQTT</strong>: Disabled;Ignore;</li>
                    <li><strong>Role</strong>: Client (<strong>NOT</strong> Router & Client)</li>
                    <li><strong>Hop Count</strong>: 3</li>
                    <li><strong>Broadcast intervals</strong>(info, position, telemetry): 1 hour</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is a community driven project, following these guidelines will ensure the best experience for everyone as we continue to grow. (credit @Nick, @AdvJosh (TEX#) - KJ5FZD, @edsai KI5OSB)</p>
                <h4>MQTT</h4>
                <p>The vast majority of us have chosen not to use MQTT with Meshtastic in the spirit of building out a stronger RF based mesh network, instead of relying on the internet to patch coverage gaps. We also recommend setting your nodes to ignore any MQTT traffic.</p>
                <p>If you use a busy MQTT server/topic it can quickly overwhelm your node and flood the entire network with traffic rendering local communications difficult or impossible. Additionally, using MQTT can give us a false sense of how robust our local RF network is, make it difficult to optimize, diagnose issues and plan future network expansion. Our goal is to build a robust, reliable off grid network that can be utilized by our community during internet/power outages.</p>
                <h4>Device Role</h4>
                <p>It may be tempting to set your device to ‘client/router’ or one of the other infrastructure modes, however from our extensive testing we’ve seen the best results for the end user, and the network as a whole using the ‘client’ role. Meshtastic does not currently have any intelligent routing built into the firmware. Nodes are set to rebroadcast any message they receive that they have not heard rebroadcast from another node at a random time interval. The ‘client/router’ and other infrastructure role takes that random interval and subtracts another random interval ensuring that they rebroadcast first.</p>
                <p>While this may sound good on paper, due to constantly changing environmental variables you may be inadvertently creating dead ends in the network, bypassing intended recipients, and closing off redundant routing paths. We highly recommend starting with a ‘client’ role even for well placed nodes.</p>
                <p>For device connected nodes (the ones you're sending messages from) that are not contributing to the network we recommend a device role of ‘client mute’ to reduce overall network airtime. An example of this would be a device connected node in your home that goes through a relay node on your roof.</p>
                <h4>Hop Count</h4>
                <p>We recommend starting with a hop count of 3, and always using the minimum number of hops needed to reach your destination. If you are running a device connected node in your home and a relay node that your client always goes through, a hop count of 4 is advised. If you are on the edge of the network and are not achieving results with the above, 5 hops may be useful however we recommend ensuring that you've done all you can with regard to optimizing your node hardware and placement first, if these are not taken care of additional hops will not yield greater distance and will degrade the performance of the wider network.</p>
                <h4>Broadcast Interval (Position, Telemetry, Node Info)</h4>
                <p>In order to reduce overall channel utilization and ensure messages are delivered we recommend the following settings for everyday use unless you have a specific use case or are running a test that requires more frequent updates.</p>
                <h5>Device Config</h5>
                <p>Node Info Broadcast Interval: 1 Hour</p>
                <h5>Position</h5>
                <p>Broadcast Interval: 1 Hour, Enable Smart Position, Minimum Interval: One Minute, Minimum Distance: 100, Position Flags: Disable all flags that are not explicitly needed for your use case.</p>
                <h5>Telemetry (Sensors) Config</h5>
                <p>Device Metrics: 1 Hour, Sensor Metrics: 1 Hour</p>

                <h3 id="start-a-similar-club">How to start a similar mesh</h3>
                <p>For anyone trying to start a similar mesh network, here's what we've found to work:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The hardest part of setting up a mesh network is organizing people. For a mesh to work well you need a lot of people working to set up nodes around town. Finding these people is harder than putting together hardware.</li>
                    <li>Have regular meetings - we try to have meetings once per quarter. Sometimes we 30+ people and sometimes it's just 2 or 3 of us meeting up at the pub. But having regular meetings means people can feel confident that if they miss a meeting there will be another one soon.</li>
                    <li>Create an email list and make sure to add anyone who is interested in the club - this is the easiest way to organize meetings.</li>
                    <li>Use some type of chat room like Discord, Slack, or Telegram.</li>
                    <li>Set up social media accounts and advertise your meetings and talk about your achievements. When you get a solar power node set up be sure to talk about it!</li>
                    <li>Connect with your local ham radio club - they're very knowledgable about radio and they often have access to towers and rooftops.</li>
                    <li>Connect with your local disaster relief agency, red cross, or mutual aid group - they are also often willing to put up repeaters on their buildings.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The node at UT Austin is located on top of the Physics, Math, and Astronomy building on the South face at ~80m above ground. It provides coverage for a significant portion of West, South, and East Austin through it's 10dBi antenna and RAK19007 circuit board. The node uses a Voltaic Systems V50 battery connected to a 20w solar panel making this node entirely self supporting.</p>

                <p>The node at LASA is hosted on their rooftop and graciously supported by LASA Amateur Radio Club. While the antenna and position change slightly from time to time for experiments, this node uses a RAK19007 baseboard with an 8w solar panel connected to a Voltaic Systems V50 battery. It provides coverage for a significant portion of East, South East, and even some areas of South West Austin.</p>
